# 'rules' test is disabled in GPDB. Maintaining the list of views in it is
# too painful, and there are also errors because of cross-segment UPDATEs

# GPDB_84_MERGE_FIXME: While disabling this was not really an effect of the 8.4

# Output of the 'combocid' test contains ctid and cmin values, which will
# differ depending on how many segments are used. Hence disabled in GPDB.

# 'foreign_key' test is disabled, because it contains several tables with
